                        The Pomodoro method is a full focus, work or study during 25 minutes, then you have a little 5 minutes break when the time is off. After repeating it 4 times, you have a longer 30 minutes break before you start again.

                        The idea of it is to concentrate the most on the task you have to do without any distractions you could have. This way you develop an effective productivity, organize your time more efficiently and probably achieve multiple goals throughout the day.
